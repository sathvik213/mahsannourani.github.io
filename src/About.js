          My interdisciplinary research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), social sciences, and psychology. I study people's interactions with and understanding of AI/ML systems, specifically those used for AI-assisted decision-making. Through my research, I have studied the impact of various human factors on effective collaborative decision-making, such as human-machine trust, cognitive and societal biases, and past experiences. Moreover, I study the effectiveness of designing and incorporating explainability and algorithmic transparency techniques in AI/ML systems and interactive tools. My research has implications for building ethical and responsible AI systems. As an advocated for building trustworthy AI systems, I found and co-organized the Workshop on TRust and EXpertise (<a href="https://trexvis.github.io/Workshop2022/" className="title-blues link"><b><i className="fas fa-users"></i> TREX VIS</b></a>) at IEEE VIS Conference (2020&ndash;2022).

          Previously, I was a research intern at <i className="fab fa-apple logo"></i> <b className="title-blues">Apple</b> Technology Development Group, working on understanding CVML data workflows in extended reality systems. I was also a research intern at <i className="fab fa-microsoft logo"></i> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/fate/" className="title-blues link"><b>Microsoft Research FATE NYC</b></a>, studying the explainability of human errors for bias mitigation. I recevived my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Florida in 2023, under supervision of <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~eragan/" className="title-blues link"><b>Dr. Eric Ragan</b></a>, and my B.E. in Computer Engineering from University of Tehran in 2017.

          If you are curious, my first name is pronounced as <i>'/mæhsʌn/'</i>.
          The 'h' is not silent, but I understand it can be challenging to
          pronounce. In Farsi, my mother tongue, Mahsan means '
          <i>beautiful, as the moon <i className="fas fa-moon title-blues"></i></i>'.
